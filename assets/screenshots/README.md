# Localized Landing Screenshots

Put localized screenshots here. The landing page reads these files based on `?locale=`:

- `en-dashboard.png`
- `en-trainings.png`
- `ua-dashboard.png`
- `ua-trainings.png`
- `ru-dashboard.png`
- `ru-trainings.png`

If a locale-specific image is missing, the site falls back to:

- `screen_home.png`
- `screen_profile.png`
